## A Place Where I Write Notes On Software Books
Usually/Previously I write my notes in my google drive like so

But aint nobody able to see that, and I have a lot to prove (as a non-degree dude), so henceforth I am trying to make my upskilling journey a bit more visible and pray HR and recruiters notice it 😭

## How Will The Notes Look Like
Will be noting down things I find interesting or helpful, as well as my own thoughts. It will not be a comprehensive chapter/topic summary.
